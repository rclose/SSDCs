# SSDCs
This repository contains the R code for analyses presented in Close et al. (2018), "How should we estimate diversity in the fossil record? Testing richness estimators using sampling-standardised discovery curves." *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. This code was written by Roger A. Close. These analyses generate sampling-standardised discovery curves from Paleobiology Database occurrence datasets, revealing how sampling standardised diversity estimates have changed as fossil discoveries have historically accumulated.

To run these analyses, execute the script `0. DTTTT.R`. Paleobiology Database occurrence datasets for 1) North American Mesozoic--Ypresian tetrapods, and 2) global dinosaurs are included in this repository. These can be replaced with Paleobiology Database occurrence data of your choice.
